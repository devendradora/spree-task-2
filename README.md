Spree Task 2
=============

### This task is for third year students applying for Web Team in Springspree 2015.
The application you are creating is a small block of registration for Springspree's attendees. You are required to create a sign up page where you take in the following details and store them in a database (preberably MySQL):
* Name
* Email
* Phone Number
* Password
* College Name
* Date of birth
* Sign Up Date
* Profile Photo

Once the user sign's up, there should be a mechanism to sign him in. Create a sign in page, where the user can enter his email-id and password for signing in. Once signed in, fetch all the details he had entered earlier and display it. Note: The profile photo must also be displayed.

In addition to above, you are required to do the following:

1. Store the IP address of the user when he signs up

2. Raw passwords must not be stored and must be hashed

3. Last login date & time must be recorded
